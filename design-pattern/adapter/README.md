## Also known as
Wrapper

## Intent
Convert the interface of a class into another interface the clients
expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of
incompatible interfaces.

## Explanation

Real world example

> Consider that you have some pictures in your memory card and you need to transfer them to your computer. In order to transfer them you need some kind of adapter that is compatible with your computer ports so that you can attach memory card to your computer. In this case card reader is an adapter.
> Another example would be the famous power adapter; a three legged plug can't be connected to a two pronged outlet, it needs to use a power adapter that makes it compatible with the two pronged outlet.
> Yet another example would be a translator translating words spoken by one person to another

In plain words

> Adapter pattern lets you wrap an otherwise incompatible object in an adapter to make it compatible with another class.

Wikipedia says

> In software engineering, the adapter pattern is a software design pattern that allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface. It is often used to make existing classes work with others without modifying their source code.

**Programmatic Example**

Consider a captain that can only use rowing boats and cannot sail at all.

First we have interfaces `RowingBoat` and `FishingBoat`

```java
public interface RowingBoat {
  void row();
}

public class FishingBoat {
  private static final Logger LOGGER = LoggerFactory.getLogger(FishingBoat.class);
  public void sail() {
    LOGGER.info("The fishing boat is sailing");
  }
}
```

And captain expects an implementation of `RowingBoat` interface to be able to move

```java
public class Captain implements RowingBoat {

  private RowingBoat rowingBoat;

  public Captain(RowingBoat rowingBoat) {
    this.rowingBoat = rowingBoat;
  }

  @Override
  public void row() {
    rowingBoat.row();
  }
}
```

Now let's say the pirates are coming and our captain needs to escape but there is only fishing boat available. We need to create an adapter that allows the captain to operate the fishing boat with his rowing boat skills.

```java
public class FishingBoatAdapter implements RowingBoat {

  private static final Logger LOGGER = LoggerFactory.getLogger(FishingBoatAdapter.class);

  private FishingBoat boat;

  public FishingBoatAdapter() {
    boat = new FishingBoat();
  }

  @Override
  public void row() {
    boat.sail();
  }
}
```

And now the `Captain` can use the `FishingBoat` to escape the pirates.

```java
Captain captain = new Captain(new FishingBoatAdapter());
captain.row();
```

## Applicability
Use the Adapter pattern when

* you want to use an existing class, and its interface does not match the one you need
* you want to create a reusable class that cooperates with unrelated or unforeseen classes, that is, classes that don't necessarily have compatible interfaces
* you need to use several existing subclasses, but it's impractical to adapt their interface by subclassing every one. An object adapter can adapt the interface of its parent class.
* most of the applications using third party libraries use adapters as a middle layer between the application and the 3rd party library to decouple the application from the library. If another library has to be used only an adapter for the new library is required without having to change the application code.

## Consequences:
Class and object adapters have different trade-offs. A class adapter

*	adapts Adaptee to Target by committing to a concrete Adaptee class. As a consequence, a class adapter won’t work when we want to adapt a class and all its subclasses.
*	let’s Adapter override some of Adaptee’s behavior, since Adapter is a subclass of Adaptee.
*	introduces only one object, and no additional pointer indirection is needed to get to the adaptee.

An object adapter	

*	let’s a single Adapter work with many Adaptees—that is, the Adaptee itself and all of its subclasses (if any). The Adapter can also add functionality to all Adaptees at once.
*	makes it harder to override Adaptee behavior. It will require subclassing Adaptee and making Adapter refer to the subclass rather than the Adaptee itself.

# 思考

适配器允许一个类通过特定的编码方式（规范接口作为媒介）调用另一个本不相关的类的功能

如：USB读卡器，读卡器能够适配TF内存卡尺寸，并且能够适配电脑的USB插口，最终实现让电脑可以通过USB口读取内存卡内容

TF卡本和USB没有任何关系：

```java
public interface USB接口 {
  void 读写USB设备();
}

public class TF卡 {
  public void 读写内存卡() {
  }
}
```



```java
public class 电脑 implements USB接口 {

  private USB接口 USB接口;

  public 装配USB插槽(USB接口 USB接口) {
    this.USB接口 = USB接口;
  }

  @Override
  public void 读写USB设备() {
    USB接口.读写USB设备();
  }
}
```

加上适配器：读卡器

```java
public class USB读卡器 implements USB接口 {

  private TF卡 读卡器的TF卡槽;

  public TF卡插入读卡器() {
    读卡器的TF卡槽 = new TF卡();
  }

  @Override
  public void 读写USB设备() {
    TF卡.读写内存卡();
  }
}
```

电脑插上读卡器后

```java
电脑 PC = new 电脑(new USB读卡器());
PC.读取USB内容();
```
